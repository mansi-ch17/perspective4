Thanks for using Perspective. Our mission is to deepen people’s understanding of the world and spread ideas that matter.

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) apply to your access to and use of the websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) provided by A Perspective Corporation (“Perspective” or “we”). By clicking your consent (e.g. “Continue,” “Sign-in,” or “Sign-up,”) or by using our Services, you agree to these Terms, including the mandatory arbitration provision and class action waiver in the Resolving Disputes; Binding Arbitration Section.

Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your information while our Rules outline your responsibilities when using our Services. By using our Services, you’re agreeing to be bound by these Terms and our Rules. Please see our Privacy Policy for information about how we collect, use, share and otherwise process information about you.

If you have any questions about these Terms or our Services, please contact us at legal@Perspective.com.

Your Account and Responsibilities
<br>
You’re responsible for your use of the Services and any content you provide, including compliance with applicable laws. Content on the Services may be protected by others’ intellectual property rights. Please don’t copy, upload, download, or share content unless you have the right to do so.
<br>
Your use of the Services must comply with our Rules.
<br>
You may need to register for an account to access some or all of our Services. Help us keep your account protected. Safeguard your password to the account, and keep your account information current. We recommend that you do not share your password with others.
<br>
If you’re accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of someone else (such as another person or entity), you represent that you’re authorized to do so, and in that case the words “you” or “your” in these Terms include that other person or entity.
<br>
To use our Services, you must be at least 13 years old.
<br>
If you use the Services to access, collect, or use personal information about other Perspective users (“Personal Information”), you agree to do so in compliance with applicable laws. You further agree not to sell any Personal Information, where the term “sell” has the meaning given to it under applicable laws.
<br>
For Personal Information you provide to us (e.g. as a Newsletter Editor), you represent and warrant that you have lawfully collected the Personal Information and that you or a third party has provided all required notices and collected all required consents before collecting the Personal Information. You further represent and warrant that Perspective’s use of such Personal Information in accordance with the purposes for which you provided us the Personal Information will not violate, misappropriate or infringe any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights) and will not cause us to violate any applicable laws.
<br><br>
User Content on the Services
<br><br>
Perspective may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and our Rules, and reserves the right to remove any violating content.
<br>
Perspective reserves the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing the intellectual property rights of others, and to terminate accounts of repeat infringers. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law; please report such notices using our Copyright Policy.
<br><br>
Rights and Ownership
<br><br>
You retain your rights to any content you submit, post or display on or through the Services.
<br>
Unless otherwise agreed in writing, by submitting, posting, or displaying content on or through the Services, you grant Perspective a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully paid, and sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform and display your content and any name, username or likeness provided in connection with your content in all media formats and distribution methods now known or later developed on the Services.
<br>
Perspective needs this license because you own your content and Perspective therefore can’t display it across its various surfaces (i.e., mobile, web) without your permission.
<br>
This type of license also is needed to distribute your content across our Services. For example, you post a story on Perspective. It is reproduced as versions on both our website and app, and distributed to multiple places within Perspective, such as the homepage or reading lists. A modification might be that we show a snippet of your work (and not the full post) in a preview, with attribution to you. A derivative work might be a list of top authors or quotes on Perspective that uses portions of your content, again with full attribution. This license applies to our Services only, and does not grant us any permissions outside of our Services.
<br>
So long as you comply with these Terms, Perspective gives you a limited, personal, non-exclusive, and non-assignable license to access and use our Services.
<br>
The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign laws. These Terms don’t grant you any right, title or interest in the Services, other users’ content on the Services, or Perspective trademarks, logos or other brand features.
<br>
Separate and apart from the content you submit, post or display on our Services, we welcome feedback, including any comments, ideas and suggestions you have about our Services. We may use this feedback for any purpose, in our sole discretion, without any obligation to you. We may treat feedback as nonconfidential.
<br>
We may stop providing the Services or any of its features within our sole discretion. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage and may remove or limit content distribution on the Services.
<br><br>
Termination
<br><br>
You’re free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services with or without notice.
<br><br>
Transfer and Processing Data
<br><br>
In order for us to provide our Services, you agree that we may process, transfer and store information about you in the US and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.
<br><br>
Indemnification
<br><br>
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Perspective, and our officers, directors, agents, partners and employees (individually and collectively, the “Perspective Parties”) from and against any losses, liabilities, claims, demands, damages, expenses or costs (“Claims”) arising out of or related to your violation, misappropriation or infringement of any rights of another (including intellectual property rights or privacy rights) or your violation of the law. You agree to promptly notify Perspective Parties of any third-party Claims, cooperate with Perspective Parties in defending such Claims and pay all fees, costs and expenses associated with defending such Claims (including attorneys’ fees). You also agree that the Perspective Parties will have control of the defense or settlement, at Perspective’s sole option, of any third-party Claims.
<br><br>
Disclaimers — Service is “As Is”
<br><br>
Perspective aims to give you great Services but there are some things we can’t guarantee. Your use of our Services is at your sole risk. You understand that our Services and any content posted or shared by users on the Services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. In addition, Perspective doesn’t represent or warrant that our Services are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. No advice or information obtained from Perspective or through the Services will create any warranty or representation not expressly made in this paragraph. Perspective may provide information about third-party products, services, activities or events, or we may allow third parties to make their content and information available on or through our Services (collectively, “Third-Party Content”). We do not control or endorse, and we make no representations or warranties regarding, any Third-Party Content. You access and use Third-Party Content at your own risk. Some locations don’t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph and so they might not apply to you.
